This project contains files through Treehouse regarding my completion of HTML Forms. This readme file will be updated frequently.

Update: This form currently is not operated by PHP, so the form currently isn't functional. This will change with future updates.

Update (5/9/05): Added checkboxes, radio buttons, and a select menu for choosing gender.
